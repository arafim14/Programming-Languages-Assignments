# Programming-Languages-Assignments
Classwork for Programming Languages class at Rowan University

In this class, the assignment was to write the same program in (at least) 3 languages:
- Scheme (LISP)
- Ada
- PROLOG

(The Prolog Version does not print a list at the end. Not because it isn't supposed to, but just because I didn't finish it)
